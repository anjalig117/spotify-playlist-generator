###Spotifys

Firstly, this project was inspired by **Hackernoon's from side project to finished app**

**Spotify's Web API** is in the root for app that will help users to create playlists and discover new music based on their liked artists.

The core functionality of project could be summed up in the below:
1. A user should be able to type and search for an artist.
2. Related artists of the searched one would be available for selection.
3.Every subsequent selection would trigger a new request for related artists.
4. Creating a pool of popular songs from the selected artists and randomly picking a subset of those.
5. If the user wants to save the resulting playlist to his/her Spotify, authorize by logging into Spotify and getting a required access token.
6. Create the playlist on user's profile and add the required tracks.


To access the Spotify WebAPI, one needs the **Client Id** and **Client Secret** from the API by creating a new app in your spotify's account dashboard.

This project is based on an **API** and this application user can access their Spotify's account data such as playlists, following, etc. and satisfies all the requirements of Capstone project.
